 Romania's TrainLine Future 2030
1.I am trying to implement my vision into Roomania's main trinline for the next year to become what we once were a connefted country with the whole globe.

Please install the libraries from rrequirements.txt file wiht : pip freeze >./requirements.txt or just pip install -r requirements.txt
Create your app.py file that contains the main functions of the projects and the link to the bootstrap files , in our case just index.html
Create index.html file and add the views option as the file fro mthe project, verify it and add optional functions as per you own perspective.
Finally enjoy and do code as it completely change your life fr the better; yours and all around :)
